# C language + CMake + Unity test framework

A very simple project to test [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and the [Unity test framework](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/) with the C language.
~~This is also a test for the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).~~
This is also a test for Travis CI and SonarCloud integration.
